# random-anime
 
This is my first projekt with GitHub and i am trying to get in the whole World of Programming. Btw. It was not my idea i got the idea from someone else on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xf1TMs0ysk&list=LL&index=16) full credits to Tina Huang for the inspiration.

## First Version

The **first** version has a simple list of anime that I have watched or am still am watching. It should retrun a random element of the list with `choice()` which I imported from `random`

## Second Version

The second version is still in planning but I want to have the user to input a few anime and then get a random anime. 

## Third Version

Didnt thouhgt about it yet.
