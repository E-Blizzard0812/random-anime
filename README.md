# random-anime
 
This is my first projekt with GitHub and I am trying to get in the whole World of Programming. Btw. It was not my idea I got the idea from someone else on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xf1TMs0ysk&list=LL&index=16) full credits to Tina Huang for the inspiration.

## First Version

The **first** version has a simple list of anime that I have watched or am still am watching. It should retrun a random element of the list with `choice()` which I imported from `random`.

## Second Version
**The current Version**

In the second version you get to choose if you want to use the prebuild list or input your own list. The user is asked to input a few different series and get a randomly selected element of the inputed String. The prebuild list is now a dictonary. After some testing the dict in this case is slower but I will keep it because want to work more with dictonarys.   

## Third Version

**The third Version is still in progress**

In the third version the should have build in APIs (mainly `Jikan` and `Pandas`).  `Jikan` is an unofficial API which is "connects" yourself with MyAnimeList, which has tons of Animes ranked and can be used to find everything from old ones to upcomming Animes in the Future. `Pandas` wil sort the output `Jikan` provides and makes it better to read.
